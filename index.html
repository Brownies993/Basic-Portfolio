      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p> I'm 18 years old and l'm the youngest of 3, me being the third child. It has it's querks being the baby of the house so to speak because the third one are the best and thats that. Alao having a birthday during the summer means that ice cream cake is essential. However, though thats all cool and stuff.. I'm  a simple guy with simple needs and who loves watching youtube videos. I find it amazing that you can pratically learn anything on youtube which is awsome. But if there's one thing people would remember me by is that l have a unique laugh and its not the same. Depending on the joke or sometimes how I'm feeling my laughs are different.
